## Introduction
Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) aim to map entities and relations from knowledge graphs into low-dimensional space while preserving the graph structure. Over recent years, KGE has played a significant role in various applications such as recommendation systems, question-answering systems, and healthcare.

This document aims to review the progress in KGE research from 2021 to 2024 in top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, AAAI, ACL, EMNLP, IJCAI, SIGIR, WWW and KDD. We will analyze the most influential papers of each year, explore the evolution of methods, and discuss future directions.
